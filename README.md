# Netflix-Data-analysis-Python-project-
This project analyzes Netflix movie data using Python. I preprocessed the dataset with Pandas &amp; NumPy, handled missing values, and explored key questions on genres, popularity, and yearly trends. Visualizations with Matplotlib &amp; Seaborn reveal insights into Netflix’s content and user preferences.
# 📊 Netflix Movie Data Analysis  

This project explores a **Netflix movie dataset** to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about genres, popularity, and yearly releases. The dataset contains more than **9,000 movies**, and the analysis is done using Python libraries for data processing and visualization.  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used  
- **NumPy** → Numerical computations  
- **Pandas** → Data preprocessing and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** → Visualization with plots and charts  
- **Seaborn** → Advanced and aesthetic visualizations

## 📂 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent data  
   - Removed duplicates and formatted columns  
   - Prepared dataset for exploration  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Answered key questions:  
   - 📌 What is the most frequent genre of movies on Netflix?  
   - 📌 Which movie has the **highest vote average**?  
   - 📌 Which movie has the **highest popularity** and its genre?  
   - 📌 Which movie has the **lowest popularity** and its genre?  
   - 📌 Which year saw the most movies released?  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Created bar charts, histograms, and count plots  
   - Used Seaborn & Matplotlib for clear, attractive visual representation

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Certain genres dominate Netflix’s movie collection  
- Popularity and user votes don’t always correlate directly  
- The number of movies released varies widely across years
